## Overview

Welcome to my web portfolio! This README provides insights into my process, challenges faced during development, and key learnings from creating this portfolio.

## Process

### Planning:
- **Goal Setting:** I began by defining the objectives of my portfolio, such as showcasing my photography work and providing contact information for potential clients.
- **Design Concept:** I sketched wireframes and developed a design concept that aligns with my personal style and professional goals.

### Development:
- **Technology Stack:** I chose to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development, with Bootstrap for responsive design.
- **Iterative Development:** I adopted an iterative approach, continuously refining and improving my portfolio as I progressed.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Responsive Design
- **Issue:** Ensuring consistent display across various devices posed a challenge, particularly with grid layouts.
- **Solution:** I utilized Bootstrap's grid system and media queries to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

### Challenge: Masonry Layout Stability
- **Issue:** Initially, I encountered issues with the Masonry layout library resetting upon navigating back to the page.
- **Solution:** I implemented JavaScript logic to recalibrate the Masonry layout whenever the page visibility changes, ensuring stability and consistency.

### Challenge: Centering Content on Small Screens
- **Issue:** Aligning content center on small screens while maintaining responsiveness was challenging.
- **Solution:** I utilized Bootstrap's utility classes and grid system to center content horizontally on small screens.

## Key Learnings

- **Problem-Solving:** Overcoming challenges during development enhanced my problem-solving abilities and expanded my technical proficiency.
- **Responsive Design Best Practices:** Creating a responsive design taught me valuable lessons in optimizing user experience across various devices.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Building my portfolio reinforced the importance of continuous learning and improvement in web development.
